# Face-Detection-using-Open-CV-and-Machine-learning-technique
In this I have used python coding for presenting a face detector with a reasonably good accuracy and running time and which can count no. of faces in any image or real time webcam. In this I wrote a single code for two types of cases using "for" loop with the help of haarcascade classifier
1) when an image is selected for face detection
2) when a webcam is used for detecting faces on live
3) Count the number of faces in an image or on a real time webcam and show the count
